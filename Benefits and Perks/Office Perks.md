# Office Perks

## Meals

Foodies welcome! We offer lunch five days a week, and dinner can be expensed for anyone who wants to work at the office past 6 p.m. Let Margaret know if you have dietary restrictions.

## Gym Membership

Nylas offers reimbursements on gym memberships up to $70 a month (a maximum paid monthly that does not roll over). Fitness SF is conveniently located a few blocks from the office. Another nearby favorite for our climbers is Mission Cliffs. Please contact Margaret for reimbursement or if you need helping finding a gym.

## In-Office Massages

Every other Wednesday, Nylas has a full-day massage therapist in the office. Feel free to make your appointment through [Infinity Massage](https://my.infinitemassage.com/login.php).

## Lyft Credit

Nylas offers a $100 Lyft credit each month to get you to and from the office. Just log into the Lyft app with your @nylas.com email address. This credit is a maximum paid monthly and does not roll over.

## Commuter Benefits

Tax-free commuter benefits allow you to reduce your monthly commuting expenses for transit, carpooling, bicycling, and work-related parking costs. You can sign up for this perk through your WageWorks account. Please note that there is an annual maximum for this pre-tax benefit. The maximum dollar amount is found in IRS Publication 15-B.
