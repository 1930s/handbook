# Medical Benefits and Policies

## Medical, Vision, and Dental Insurance 

Nylas provides competitive medical, vision, and dental benefits for all full-time staff members (40 hours) and their families. We also provide membership to One Medical to ease the burden of finding a primary care doctor. Benefits begin the on the 1st of the month after your start date and Nylas’ open enrollment period is during the month of February. Please contact Margaret if you have any coverage questions.

## HSA, FSA, and Dependent Care FSA

**Health Savings Accounts (HSA)** allows eligible employees to be reimbursed for qualified medical expenses. Contributions are pre-tax and lower the total amount of tax paid by you. Nylas plans are set up and facilitated by Avidia Bank and remaining balances are generally carried over to the next year.

**Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)** allows eligible employees to be reimbursed for qualified medical expenses. Contributions are pre-tax and lower the total amount of tax paid by you. Remaining balances are not carried over in next year.

Compared with HSA, FSA has lower annual maximum contribution limits. Also, the funds are part of a “use it or lose it” plan, meaning that what is left over at the end of the year is not returned to you.

**Dependent Care FSA** reimburses eligible employees for expenses to care for dependents while they are  at work (e.g. Daycares). Contributions are pre-tax and lower the total amount of tax paid by employees and the employer. Remaining balances are not carried over to the next year. Single parents or Married couples filing a joint return can elect up to $5000 per year. Married couples filing separate returns are limited to $2500 elections each.

## One Medical             

Nylas sponsors membership benefits to One Medical for full time employees. The benefit includes same/next-day appointments that start on time! Plus 24/7 phone access to a virtual medical team.

## COBRA

COBRA allows employees to continue to receive benefits under their health plans after losing coverage due to a change from full-time to part-time employment, or after termination. From an employee's perspective, COBRA coverage is essentially the same as normal full-time. Employees and their beneficiaries may elect this plan within 60 days of the last day of regular coverage, and must pay all monthly premiums on time, as administered by Zenefits.
