# Vocabulary

Welcome to Nylas! Here’s a list of useful terms we use within the company. 📚 

## General
- *LOL*—a Spang-ism that denotes amusement.
- *Grok*—to understand profoundly and intuitively (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok).
- *Modulo*—remainder; what’s left or left to do.
- *OOO*—out of office.
- *PTO*—paid time off.
- *Retrospective*—where we talk about whats working well and poorly across teams and the company.
- *RGR*—“Roger”; yes.
- *SGTM*—sounds good to me.
- *Standup*—a daily meeting where everyone answers what they did yesterday, what they are doing today, and what blocks them.
- *TL;DR*—too long; didn’t read. Usually used as a request for summary (i.e., “What’s the TL;DR on this meeting?”).
- *WFH*—working from home.

## Engineering
- *API*—an application programming interface, or a protocol that allows different pieces of software to interact. In our case, we build a web service that allows other developers to make certain requests to our systems to perform certain actions (i.e., sending an email on behalf of a user).
- *Branch*—a copy of the codebase. It usually contains a person’s changes (a feature, a bug fix, etc.). There are many branches on each project, but the primary branch is “master”—the working codebase from which everyone else creates new branches and later merges in their changes. There’s also the “production” branch, which contains the code that gets deployed to our users.
- *cloud-core*—our main repo (or project) for our code. It includes the code for the API, the sync engine, the dashboard, and more.
- *cURL*—a method of making HTTP requests to access our APIs.
- *Diff*—a differential, or the changes between the current codebase that everyone shares and the code that someone has written. We “submit” diffs to others to review our code, and then we “land” them onto the primary codebase, which makes our changes available to everyone else.
- *Embiggen*—to make bigger
- *Endpoint*—a URL where a service can be accessed. For instance, our `/messages` endpoint for the Nylas API can be accessed at https://api.nylas.com/messages.
- *Jenkins*—our server that runs automated tests of code functionality and creates new builds from our code on each new change.
- *Kickoff*—a meeting at the start of the week to look at Phab tasks, assign them to different engineers, and check on the progress of current projects.
- *MySQL*—the database software that we use to underpin most of our service.
- *On-call*—a rotating role on the engineering team to address emergencies and urgent customer-facing issues. Engineers take a cycling week-long shift to be the go-to person responsible for handling incidents (i.e., if the API is down).
- *Performant*—efficient. A performant solution to a problem is optimal in terms of speed.
- *Phab*—Phabricator, or our tool for code review and task management.
- *Refactor*—to rewrite and restructure old code in a way that works better.
- *Regression*—an old bug or issue that returns inadvertently after an update to the codebase.
- *SDK*—software development kit, or a wrapper around the APIs. An SDK makes it easier for developers to integrate with the APIs since it allows them to use their language of choice instead of having to make raw HTTP or cURL requests to our endpoints.
- *Shipping*—releasing a feature or a bug fix to our customers.
- *Sprint*—a unit of time for which engineering work is allocated. Usually one or two weeks.
- *SQL*—the language used to operate on databases.

## Marketing
- *CMS*—content management system, or software that typically hosts a blog or a website (i.e., Hubspot, WordPress, Drupal).
- *CRM*—customer relationship management system, or software that allows the sales and marketing teams track revenue and manage customer relationships from deal stage to contract size to projected revenue for the year (i.e., Salesforce).
- *Hubspot*—our content management system (CMS) where we host our website, write content for the blog, track and report on the total number of contacts in our system and what percentage convert to leads, MQLs, SQLs, and customers.
- *MQL*—a marketing-qualified lead, or someone who has expressed interest in the product to the extent that sales should reach out to them (i.e., if they request a demo, read three of our blogs and look at our pricing page, attend a webinar).
- *PPC*—pay-per-click, or a form of online advertising where we pay each time someone clicks our ads. If you see a Nylas ad on Facebook or in Google search, don’t click them—they’re usually $2 to $5 per click!

## Sales
- *Cadences*—regular call or email campaigns to prospective customers.
- *Customer*—a paying account. A prospect has either entered in payment info via the dashboard or have signed a MSA agreement.
- *Opportunity*—an active sales-identified deal that the team is working to convert into a customer. Opportunities (and deals) typically move through six stages: Conversation, Qualified to Buy, In Review, Proof-of-Concept, Contract Negotiation, and Closed Win/Lost.
- *MRR*—monthly recurring revenue, or the amount we charge our customer monthly on an ongoing subscription basis.
- *MSA Agreement*—Master Service Agreement, or a contract that a prospect optionally signs to become a Nylas customer. MSAs are typically a one-year contractual agreement. Stands for “Master Services Agreement”.
- *Deal*—an opportunity that’s progressed to the contract stage and has a concrete value attached to it. Used informally.
- *Pipeline*—the portfolio of deals/opportunities that are currently in the works. Pipelines help sales reps to track the stages of their deals, such as when their deal is projected to close, the dollar amount of their deals, and any additional support/scope needed to help win the deal.
- *Prospect*—a company or person with a potential need for Nylas’ APIs.
- *SQL*—a sales-qualified lead, or a person or company that’s been identified/confirmed as a good customer fit.
