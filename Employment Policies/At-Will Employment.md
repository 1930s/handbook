# At-Will Employment

While we sincerely hope that your employment here at Nylas will be a positive and rewarding experience, we cannot, for legal reasons, make any guarantees about your continued employment. Your employment here is at will. This means that you are free to quit at any time, for any reason, just as we are free to terminate your employment at any time, for any reason with or without notice, with or without cause.

No employee or Nylas representative, other than the Board of Directors, has the authority to change the at-will employment relationship or to contract with any employee for different terms of employment. Furthermore, the Board of Directors may change the at-will employment relationship only in a written contract, signed by the Board and the employee. Nothing in this Handbook constitutes a contract or promise of continued employment.
