# Remote Work

There are varying levels of “remoteness” that should be treated with increasing levels of care. In general, the more remote you are, the more preparation, forewarning, and effort should be put into it.

1. Occasional home or coffee shop work:
  1. Does not require manager approval.
  2. Notify the team on Slack, ideally day-before or at the latest early morning, where you’ll be and when.
  3. There’s no explicit cap on the number of times you can do it—it’s your responsibility to coordinate with your team and proactively watch out for how this is affecting them.
2. Occasional remote trips within 3 timezones. 2-4 days:
  1. Does not require manager approval.
  2. Notify the team at least several days before you leave. Ideally once when a trip is booked and again the day or two before. Explicitly make sure people on your team know.
  3. Research ahead of time to know that you’ll have stable wifi, a place to sit, and a reasonable noise level.
  4. Block out the overall time as a multi-day event so people can see overall when you’re out
  5. Block out individual chunks where you’ll be in transit or AFK.
3. Occasional long remote trips (~5+ days) within 3 timezones, or anything > 3 timezones:
  1. Requires manager approval.
  2. Give even more notification time for the trip. Ensure this is taken into account for project planning.
4. Regular remote segments within 3 timezones:
  1. Requires manager approval and training.
  2. Must be fully co-located at least the first three months of starting to work at Nylas.
5. Full-time remote:
  1. Case-by-case and highly role-dependent.
